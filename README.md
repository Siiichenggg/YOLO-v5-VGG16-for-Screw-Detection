# YOLO-v5-VGG16-for-Screw-Detection

YOLO v5 trained by screw hat dataset allows you to detect screw and its place. 
Then you can use VGG16 model trained by dataset of rusted and slipped screws to distinguish whether the screws are rusted or slipped. 
"huasi" means slipped, and "shengxiu" means rusted in my code. 
main.py is used to call the macbook's camera to detect and recognize the screws.
