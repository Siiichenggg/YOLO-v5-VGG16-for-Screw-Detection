# YOLO-v5-VGG16-for-Screw-Detection

## YOLO v5
YOLO v5 trained by screw hat dataset allows you to detect screw and its place. 

## VGG16
Then you can use VGG16 model trained by dataset of rusted and slipped screws to distinguish whether the screws are rusted or slipped. 
"huasi" means slipped, and "shengxiu" means rusted in my code.   

## main.py
main.py created a GUI as well as a call to the Macbook's camera to detect and recognize the screws.
